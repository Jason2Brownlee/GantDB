## About

gnatDB: Record everything!

gnatDB is a lightweight personal data tracking service that encourages users to record everything and add meaning to collected data at some later date.

gnatDB collects daily data points (data, context, and tags), for example: 10 pushups, exercise, arms and 5.50 hamburger, food, purchase, junk

The service is free with no immediate plans to monetise.

Competitors include Datum which collects data around specific contexts in the form of graphical motifs.

The competitive advantage of gnatDB is its simplicity, focusing on data capture and storage, encouraging the user to export their data into their data manipulation tools of choice at some later stage.

## Code
